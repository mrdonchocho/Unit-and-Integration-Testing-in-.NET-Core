# Web Api Coding Test instructions


## Notes

- The solution was created in Visual Studio 2019 and targets .NET Core 3.1
- The solution is dependent on a few freely available open-source packages which can be restored using the NuGet Package Manager
- The solution contains a .Net Core Web API project, exposing a simple controller which implements a simple to do list application.
- The solution also contains an NUnit test project with a unit test.
- You are free to modify the test framework setup as much or as little as you choose
- If you are having issues running the API, close down Visual Studio and navigate to the solution in File Explorer and delete the .vs folder
- When running your component tests ensure that the API is set as your start-up project and run the API via Debug > Start without Debugging (ctrl + F5)


**Please complete the following tasks:**

1. The first unit test has already been implemented.  Please run it and get it passing.

2. Implement further unit tests to increase the test coverage.

3. Implement component tests to increase the test coverage.


*Extension Tasks*

4. Refactor your test classes to improve readability and maintainability and minimise code duplication (you may use any test frameworks you wish)
